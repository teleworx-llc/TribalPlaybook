             <h1 align=center>The Tribal Journey toward broadband connectivity</h1>
                    
            <p class="normal-text">This playbook aims to support Tribal Land
            members, representatives, and leaders in their efforts to launch a fixed
            wireless network ("the Network") and organization to offer broadband services
            across their lands.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">A fixed wireless network consists of a set
                    of base stations that provide wireless connectivity to equipment installed at <i>customer
                    premises</i> (e.g., houses, businesses, institutions). In turn, base stations
                    connect via a <i>backhaul link</i> to a core site where a high-speed internet
                    connection exists. The organization that manages the network is often called a
                    wireless internet service provider (WISP).</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">Deployment of a fixed wireless network
                    requires significant investment and effort, that's why it's essential to
                    develop a business plan. The business plan will contribute to align the efforts
                    across your team, seek acceptance from tribal authorities, obtain grants, and
                    define a plan of action.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">To generate your business plan, this
                    playbook will guide you through the so-called &quot;Tribal Journey&quot; shown
                    in Figure 1. Each tribal land journey toward broadband connectivity may be
                    slightly different, based on skills, expertise, budget, timeframes,
                    preferences, strategy, and other requirements.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">This playbook aims to guide you and provide
                    you with the required knowledge and tools to complete your journey in a simple
                    and smooth way. Along this journey the outputs of each step can be integrated
                    into the <a class="a_link" href="bussiness_plan_temp">Business Plan template</a>
                    or just gathered for final integration in step 7.</p>

                    <p align=center><i>Figure 1 &mdash; The Tribal Land Journey toward
                    broadband connectivity.</i></p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">Below, the steps of the journey are briefly
                    described:</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text"><b>Step 1.
                    Perform market and coverage analysis</b></p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">Assess the current situation in the areas of interest
                    within your tribal land, identifying the connectivity needs and opportunities
                    as well as the service offering from large carriers and local ISPs.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">Based on this analysis, establish target areas and sites to
                    be covered by your Network; then, obtain data regarding population and housing
                    units within the target areas.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">This step is one of the pillars to develop an effective
                    business plan; everything else will part of the analysis of target areas and
                    connectivity needs.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">In this step, the playbook will provide you with the
                    necessary guidance and the <a class="a_link" href="tribal_mapping_tool">Tribal Mapping tool</a> to execute the associated tasks.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text"><b>Step 2. Define service offerings</b></p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">Based on the findings from the previous step and your own strategy,
                    define the types of services &mdash; residential, business, institutional &mdash; and
                    speeds to be offered by your Network. For each service, establish the price and
                    any subsidies that will be provided to your customers.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">In addition to services, this step considers the
                    establishment of the sales and marketing strategy. Here you will define how
                    your subscribers can contract and pay for the network services and how to
                    promote adoption of them.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">This is an important milestone that provides inputs for the
                    network design and financial analysis.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text"><b>Step 3. Assess key resources</b></p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">Collect data regarding critical resources for the Network
                    deployment and operation, including spectrum, telecom infrastructure, and
                    funds. Collected data is used to identify resources that must be acquired. In
                    particular, data from sites that can be used to install equipment (e.g.,
                    telecom towers, buildings, water towers, silos) is utilized as one of the
                    inputs for network design.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">After this step, you may decide to engage with vendors
                    through the RFx Process in step 6 or continue toward network architecture
                    definition in step 4.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">The playbook includes a <a class="a_link" href="">data collection kit</a> and framework to gather and
                    register data of potential network sites.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text"><b>Step 4. Establish network architecture</b></p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">Assess technology and architectural options to select the
                    architecture to be implemented in your Network based on cost, feasibility,
                    operational constraints, and preferences. Establishing the architecture provides
                    clarity to all stakeholders on how the Network should look like, guiding the
                    design and selection of potential equipment vendors.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">After this step, you may decide to engage with vendors
                    through the RFx Process in step 6 or continue in the journey to develop a
                    preliminary network design in step 5.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">This step includes the necessary background and
                    instructions to generate the reference architecture description for your
                    Network through the <a class="a_link" href="">Network
                    Architecture wizard</a>, based on coverage targets
                    from step 1 and spectrum strategy from step 3.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text"><b>Step 5. Develop preliminary design</b></p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text"><a></a>This is an optional step since, in most cases,
                    consultants or vendors will develop the preliminary or high-level design for
                    your Network. Moreover, it requires an additional level of effort and execution
                    of technical procedures.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">To develop the preliminary design, you will take outcomes
                    of previous steps: coverage targets, services to be supported, site
                    infrastructure, spectrum, and network architecture. This data is used to obtain
                    the required number of network sites, network topology, and the necessary
                    network equipment, along with an estimate of the covered population.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">An efficient network design will ensure adequate coverage
                    and capacity to support the service offering while optimizing the budget.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">This step is supported through step-by-step instructions,
                    tools, and examples to develop your own design.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">After this step, you may decide to engage with vendors
                    through the RFx process in step 6. Other alternative is to use the <a class="a_link" href="">Tech
                    Solutions Matrix</a> to identify suitable network
                    equipment for your Network and obtain budgetary pricing, passing directly to
                    the financial plan in step 7.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text"><b>Step 6. Execute RFx and select vendors</b></p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">RFx is a generic term to denote a procurement method in
                    which the buyer &mdash; in this case, your Tribal Land &mdash; engages with vendors to
                    assess their products and services, before entering into commercial agreements.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">It can refer to a request for information (RFI), request
                    for proposal (RFP), or request for quotation (RFQ). The value of the RFx
                    process lies in the opportunity to obtain industry knowledge and best-in-breed
                    offerings at competitive prices.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">In this step, you will perform and manage the RFx process,
                    supported by a series of instructions and templates pre-filled with the
                    necessary data to engage with relevant vendors to deploy your Network.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">As stated before, you can enter the RFx process at various
                    steps. This will depend on your strategy and how far you want to get in the
                    journey before vendors' engagement begins.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">This playbook guides you on managing the RFx process,
                    including when and how to use the RFI, RFP, and RFQ templates.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text"><b>Step 7. Finalize your business plan</b></p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">Define the operating model, project plan, and financial
                    plan based on the outcomes from previous steps.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">The operating model includes the main activities to manage,
                    operate, and maintain your Network and the team/organization's structure in
                    charge of it.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">The project plan provides an overview of the tasks to be
                    performed to stand-up and commence the Network's operation, showing timelines
                    and responsible parties to execute each task.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">The financial plan shows details regarding capital
                    expenditures (CAPEX), operational expenditures (OPEX), and revenue based on
                    network design and service offering. Then, cash flows and financial metrics are
                    obtained.
                    <b>Generating the financial plan is essential to obtain grants and
                    other funding types since this analysis shows how the business case for the
                    Network will evolve over time.</b></p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">The necessary guidance and tools to perform this critical
                    step are provided in this playbook, including a customizable <a class="a_link" href="">financial
                    plan template</a> to generate the financial analysis.</p>
                    
                    <p class="normal-text">The rest of the playbook provides detailed
                    instructions to perform each of the steps. As you go through each step, keep in
                    mind that the journey is flexible, and you should adapt the steps according to
                    your own requirements and conditions.</p>
