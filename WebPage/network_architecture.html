                                next to the radio equipment (RRU &amp; BBU). The HSS and the PCRF can be
                                located at the access sites or at the centralized core site. In this case, the
                                R&amp;S equipment has a crucial role in the interconnection between the

                                <li>A centralized EPC means that all EPC elements
                                are located at the core site. This solution is optimal when the RAN comprises a
                                considerable number of BS, which means that the extra hardware required for the

                            better performance of the network because it enables the prioritization of
                            traffic that is crucial to the network. One approach to traffic isolation is by
                            implementing VLANs. VLANs are tags in user packets that indicates to the
                            network to handle the data in the packets in an isolated fashion. When a user
                            is assigned to a VLAN, they only can communicate to other users in the same
                            VLAN thus reaching traffic separation. Another advantage of using VLANs on the
                            network is to ease the pain of problem-solving at the network lower layers.</p>

                            static ones are not recommended to be implemented on the network since they
                            require a manual configuration and update of the routes to reach each part of

                            three main functional blocks: NMS, Billing System and Ticketing System. These
                            systems can be implemented on premise (through physical servers in the network)
                            or in the cloud (through a web server such as Amazon Web Services or Google
                            Cloud). The decision point for on-premise vs cloud is the cost. While the
                            on-premise option requires a higher initial inversion (regardless of the number
                            of users), the cloud will require a monthly fee to operate (directly dependent
                            of the number of users). Inevitably, this decision is exclusively based on the
                            number of users and considering the less expensive one. This is handled

                            performance of the network and configuration management. The NMS, ideally,
                            handles all the devices of the network independently of the vendor, version, or

                            handles the invoice generation. For tribal lands it must support 477 filing, to

                        A closer look is shown in Figure 23. The results table displays a

                        and other cost components. Estimates of number of sites, CAPEX and OPEX are
                        provided as a reference for comparison. For more accurate costs you should
                        consider performing a preliminary design following the instructions in the <a class="a_link" href="network_planning.html">Network Planning &amp; Design Module</a>.</p>

                        some directives to define an architecture when two or more architectural
